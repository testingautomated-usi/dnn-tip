If you are looking for the uncertainty metrics we also tested (including DeepGini),
head over to the sister repository [uncertainty-wizard](https://github.com/testingautomated-usi/uncertainty-wizard).

If you want to reproduce our exact experiments, there's a reproduction package and docker stuff available at [testingautomated-usi/simple-tip](https://github.com/testingautomated-usi/simple-tip).




## Installation
It's as easy as `pip install dnn-tip`.
